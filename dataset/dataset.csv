Question,Answer
What is Down syndrome?,"There are trillions of cells in the human body. They are so tiny you can only see them through a microscope. Inside these tiny cells are even tinier parts called chromosomes. Most people have 46 chromosomes in each of their cells.  People with Down syndrome have 47, and because of that they may look and learn differently."
When was Down’s syndrome discovered?,"It is believed that people with Down’s syndrome have always existed. However, it was not until 1866 that the English doctor, John Langdon Down, published the first comprehensive description of the condition, which subsequently took his name."
How common is Down syndrome?,"Down syndrome is the most common chromosome-related condition in the United States. An estimated 6,000 babies are born with the condition in the U.S. every year, which equals about 1 in every 700 babies. There are about 200,000 people in the U.S. diagnosed with Down syndrome."
How do people get Down syndrome?, You cannot “catch” Down syndrome; everyone who has Down syndrome was born with it and will always have it. Down syndrome affects people from all around the world.  Approximately one in 772 babies born in the United States has Down syndrome.
Is Down syndrome transmitted from the mother or father?,The additional genetic material which causes Down syndrome can originate from either the father or the mother. Approximately five percent of the cases have been traced to the father.
What causes Down syndrome?,"The human body is made of cells. All cells contain a center, called a nucleus, in which genes are stored. Genes, which carry the codes responsible for all our inherited characteristics, are grouped along rod-like structures called chromosomes. Normally, the nucleus of each cell contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, half of which are inherited from each parent. Down syndrome occurs when some or all of a person’s cells have an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21."
Do kids with Down syndrome like the same things as other kids?,"Yes! When you get to know someone with Down syndrome, you will find that they have unique personalities and interests, just like everyone else!  If they want to, they can be on sports teams, make art, play instruments, and join clubs at school. They want to have fun and make new friends as all kids do."
Why is it called Down syndrome?,"Down syndrome was first studied and described by a doctor named John Langdon Down. Today, the condition is named after him."
Can kids with Down syndrome go to school?,"Yes! Some may go to special schools, and others may take special classes, but many are also part of classrooms with other students who don’t have Down syndrome. They may need extra time to do their work, but they can learn the same skills as their classmates."
Are people with Down syndrome always happy?,"No! People with Down syndrome have feelings. Just like everybody else, they can feel hurt and upset by someone who is mean to them.  It is never OK to use the “r-word” to describe someone or something."
How common is Down syndrome in children?,"Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal condition. It's also the leading worldwide cause of intellectual and developmental delays in children. In the United States, approximately 6,000 babies are born with Down syndrome every year."
Is Down syndrome genetic?,"Yes, Down syndrome is a genetic disorder. Abnormal cell division leads to an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21. The extra genetic material can cause various medical and developmental issues."
Is Down syndrome inherited?,"In most cases, Down syndrome is not an inherited condition. It develops because of an error during fetal cell division. But, it is possible for a child to inherit translocation Down syndrome. This occurs when a parent's chromosomes have rearranged genetic material."
What is the Down syndrome screening process?,"There is a process of high-resolution chromosome testing is used to diagnose Down syndrome. The test uses blood or tissue cells to create a visual representation of chromosomes. The doctor will look at the size, number and shape of the baby's chromosomes. There are also several non-invasive prenatal tests to screen for Down syndrome. Amniocentesis or chorionic villi sampling both detect fetal abnormalities during pregnancy."
How is Down syndrome identified in newborns?,"Down syndrome is most often noticed at birth or shortly thereafter. Physical characteristics alone aren't enough for a diagnosis, though. Chromosome testing will confirm concerns and provide a firm diagnosis."
What are the physical characteristics of Down syndrome?,"Physical characteristics alone are not a diagnosis of Down syndrome. But, children with Down syndrome often share physical similarities. These traits include low muscle tone, small stature and upward slanting eyes. A single deep crease across the palm and wide, short hands with short fingers are also common. A baby’s physical features do not mean they have Down syndrome. Physicians use chromosome testing to make a diagnosis. It is important to remember that every child with Down syndrome is a unique individual. Children may have these physical characteristics to different degrees, or not at all."
What are the different types of Down syndrome?,"There are three types of Down syndrome. Each type impacts the body's chromosomes. Chromosomes contain the genetic information that tells our body how to grow.

1. Trisomy 21, or nondisjunction, accounts for 95% of Down syndrome cases. It happens when an extra copy of chromosome 21 is present in all cells of the body.
2. Translocation Down syndrome impacts about 4% of affected babies. It is the only type of Down syndrome that can be inherited from a parent. The baby will have three copies of chromosome 21, but one attaches to another chromosome. In trisomy 21, the extra copy is separate. To assess risk, parents can consult with a genetic counselor or geneticist.
3. Mosaic Down syndrome accounts for about 1% of Down syndrome cases. It happens when an extra copy of chromosome 21 is present in some, but not all, of the body’s cells. This type of Down syndrome results from a random event shortly after the egg and sperm join together. When cells are dividing, some cells receive an extra copy of chromosome 21. Other cells have two copies."
What are some of the medical concerns in children with Down syndrome?,"Children with Down syndrome have an increased risk for certain medical conditions. They include congenital heart defects, respiratory problems, hearing/vision problems and thyroid conditions.
A wide range of cognitive delays are also common in Down syndrome. Developmental intervention is crucial. Appropriate school placement and accommodations to help each child learn are also important. This maximizes the child’s innate strengths and talents."
What is the Down syndrome life expectancy for a child?,"The average life expectancy for a child with Down syndrome has increased dramatically. In the 1920s, the average life span for a child was nine years. Now, the average life expectancy is approximately 60 years."
What kind of quality of life can a child with Down syndrome expect?,"Quality of life for people with Down syndrome has also improved. Early medical care and developmental intervention are crucial. With support, people with Down syndrome live rich lives full of meaningful experiences. Some adults even develop the skills to live on their own and maintain a job.

To lead fulfilling and productive lives, people with Down syndrome need certain things. Good healthcare, quality educational programs and a stimulating home environment are vital. Loving support from family, friends and the community are also important. Each factor will help a person with Down syndrome lead a fulfilling and productive life."
Can Down syndrome be cured?,"There is no cure for Down syndrome; it is a lifelong condition. However, treatments for many of the medical conditions associated with Down syndrome continuously evolve and improve, increasing the expected lifespan of a person born with Down syndrome. In addition, a better understanding of Down syndrome, developments in therapy and education, and shifting societal norms mean that people with Down syndrome have more opportunities than ever before."
What are common treatments for Down syndrome?,"There is no single, standard treatment for Down syndrome. Treatments are based on each individual’s physical and intellectual needs, as well as his or her personal strengths and limitations.1 People with Down syndrome can receive proper care while living at home and in the community.
A child with Down syndrome likely will receive care from a team of health professionals, including, but not limited to, physicians, special educators, speech therapists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, and social workers. All professionals who interact with children with Down syndrome should provide stimulation and encouragement.
People with Down syndrome are at a greater risk for a number of health problems and conditions than are people who do not have Down syndrome. Many of these associated conditions may require immediate care right after birth, occasional treatment throughout childhood and adolescence, or long-term treatments throughout life. For example, an infant with Down syndrome may need surgery a few days after birth to correct a heart defect, or a person with Down syndrome may have digestive problems that require a lifelong special diet. "
"If I was told my baby might have Down syndrome, what should I expect?","You are here because you have unexpected news – your baby may have Down syndrome. We’ve prepared this information especially for parents who have either just been told the child they are expecting may have or has Down syndrome or have received a recommendation for a Down syndrome screening or diagnostic test.
Hopefully, this information reassures you that everything will be fine; however, there are some things to consider and steps to anticipate before your baby is born."
"What types of tests are available, and what can they tell me?","There are several types of screening tests available to determine the chance of having a baby with Down syndrome. Non-invasive tests including ultrasounds and testing of the mother’s blood can determine the probability of a fetus having Down syndrome. However, the only way to confirm a fetal diagnosis of Down syndrome is via invasive procedures wherein a sample of placental tissue or amniotic fluid is taken and cells are grown to produce a karyotype – a profile of the baby’s chromosomes. The following info helps to describe what each test is and the risks it may carry.
1. Ultrasound
What it is: Ultrasound is used to measure a specific area on the back of your baby’s neck. This is known as a nuchal translucency screening test. When abnormalities are present, more fluid than usual tends to collect in this neck tissue.
2. Blood Tests
What it is: This test measures the levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and the pregnancy hormone known as human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG).
3. Amniocentesis
What it is: A sample of the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus is withdrawn through a needle inserted into the mother’s uterus. This sample is then used to analyze the chromosomes of the fetus. Doctors usually perform this test in the second trimester, after 15 weeks of pregnancy. 
Risks: This test carries a slight risk of miscarriage, which increases if it’s done before 15 weeks.
4. Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)
What it is: In CVS, cells are taken from the placenta and used to analyze the fetal chromosomes. It is typically performed in the first trimester after 10 weeks of pregnancy.
Risks: This test appears to carry a somewhat higher risk of miscarriage than second trimester amniocentesis.
5. Cordocentesis
What it is: In this test, also known as percutaneous umbilical blood sampling or PUBS, fetal blood is taken from a vein in the umbilical cord and examined for chromosomal defects. Doctors can perform this test between 18 and 22 weeks of pregnancy.
Risks: This test carries a significantly greater risk of miscarriage than amniocentesis or CVS, so it’s only offered when results of other tests are unclear and the desired information can’t be obtained any other way."
Will having a baby with Down syndrome change my pregnancy?,"There is nothing in the news that changes anything about your pregnancy. Assuming you are healthy, we encourage you to enjoy the coming months.
There are exceptions: Many babies with Down syndrome have cardiovascular and gastrointestinal issues. Some can be detected prenatally, and you should consult with your medical professionals about how they may affect your delivery and your child’s postnatal care."
Are babies born with Down Syndromes only born to older mothers?,Statistically the chance of having a child with Down syndrome will increase with maternal age however around 70% of babies with Down syndrome are born to mothers under thirty-five years of age. This is because mothers under the age of thirty-five have more children overall.
Are there levels or degrees of Down Syndromes?,A diagnosis of Down syndrome refers to the presence of the additional chromosome 21. There are no levels or degrees of Down syndrome. People with Down syndrome have a range of abilities just like everyone else. 
Do people with Down Syndromes are look alike?,"There are some shared physical features of Down syndrome. However, people with Down syndrome have far more physical characteristics in common with their families."
Can people with Down Syndromes live independently?,"Many people with Down syndrome live independently. Often, they have support through NDIS to provide them with the assistance they need. Other people with Down syndrome may choose to live with their family. Independent living is becoming more common for adults with Down syndrome. Improvements in education, opportunities and most importantly, community attitudes, means more adults are living independently with varying levels of support. "
Why is it so hard to talk for my child with Down Syndromes?,"Speech relies on the coordination of breathing, muscles of the face, and the ability to make sounds representing the ideas a person wants to express. Due to differences in muscle tone, learning, memory, and structure of the face, speech development is an area of particular challenge for people with Down syndrome."
What impact does Down syndrome have on society?,"Individuals with Down syndrome are becoming increasingly integrated into society and
community organizations, such as school, health care systems, work forces and social and
recreational activities. Individuals with Down syndrome possess varying degrees of mental
retardation, from very mild to severe. Most people with Down syndrome have IQs in the
mild to moderate range of mental retardation.
Due to advances in medical technology, individuals with Down syndrome are living longer
than ever before. In 1910, children with Down syndrome were expected to survive to age
nine. With the discovery of antibiotics, the average survival age increased to 19 or 20. Now,
with recent advancements in clinical treatment, as many as 80 percent of adults with Down
syndrome reach age 55, and many live even longer.
In the United States, approximately 350,000 families are affected by Down syndrome.
Approximately 5,000 children with Down syndrome are born each year. As the mortality
rate associated with Down syndrome is decreasing, the prevalence of individuals with
Down syndrome in our society will increase. Some experts project that the number of
people with Down syndrome will double in the next 10 years. More and more Americans
will interact with individuals with this genetic condition, increasing the need for widespread
public education and acceptance. "
Who has the highest risk of having a child with Down syndrome?,"Down syndrome affects people of all races and economic levels. Women age 35 and older have a significantly increased risk of having a child with Down syndrome. A 35-year-old woman has a one in 400 chance of conceiving a child with Down syndrome and this chance increases gradually to one in 110 by age 40. At age 45 the incidence becomes approximately one in 35. Since many couples are postponing parenting until later in life, the incidence of Down syndrome conceptions is expected to increase. Therefore, genetic counseling for parents is becoming increasingly important. Still, many physicians are not fully informed about advising their patients about the incidence of Down syndrome, advancements in diagnosis and the protocols for care and treatment of babies born with Down syndrome."
Why is it important to raise children with Down syndrome at home?,"A greater understanding of Down syndrome and advancements in treatment of Down
syndrome-related health problems have allowed people with Down syndrome to enjoy fuller
and more active lives.
Children raised at home and included in all aspects of community life can best reach their
potential and function in society with a greater degree of independence. Parental love,
nurturing and support, as well as early intervention programs, educational opportunities
Questions and Answers About Down Syndrome
and community involvement, have a direct relationship to the degree that a person with
Down syndrome is able to achieve his/her potential."
How Can Parents Help?,"If your child has Down syndrome, you may at first have feelings of loss, guilt, and fear of the unknown. Talking with other parents of kids with Down syndrome may help you deal with your concerns and find ways to look toward the future. Many parents find that learning as much as they can about the condition helps ease fears.
Children with Down syndrome benefit from getting early intervention services as soon as possible. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech/feeding therapy can help, and early childhood educators can work with your child to encourage and boost development."
How will a baby with Down syndrome affect one’s family?," 
It is understandable that parents are concerned about how a child with Down syndrome will affect their family, including siblings. Every family is unique and may deal with the idea of, or the birth of, a baby with Down syndrome differently. Despite potential challenges, personal accounts and studies show that many families that have a child with Down syndrome are stable, successful and happy, and that siblings often have increased tolerance, compassion and awareness. In fact, a major study on marriages and Down syndrome shows the divorce rate among parents of children with Down syndrome is lower than the national average.

"
What should I do if I meet someone with Down’s syndrome?,"People sometimes feel nervous or unsure what to do when they first speak to someone
with Down’s syndrome. After they have met someone, people often wonder what
they were so worried about!
When you meet someone for the first time, talk to him or her and get to know
the person as you would with anyone else. You may need to check if the person
understands what you are saying and explain it again in a different way if she or he
doesn’t seem to understand. Take the lead from the person and don’t worry about
‘getting it wrong’. "
How does Down’s syndrome affect development?,"Children with Down’s syndrome generally take longer to reach developmental milestones
and they will need some additional support to learn new skills, as well as extra help
when they go to school.
Just as with all children there is a great deal of individual variation in the age at which
different skills develop, and the way the syndrome affects a person’s development,
learning and health varies widely.
You may have heard or read about ‘Early Intervention’ for children with Down’s syndrome.
Early intervention is an umbrella term for a collection of services that can help babies
and toddlers by giving early support for them and their families, with a focus on enhancing
development. Practitioners from different professions may engage with families to provide
the support they need, for example, to promote play and learning and to support
communication, speech and language."
"What is the correct terminology regarding people with
Down’s syndrome?
","Down’s syndrome is not a disease and therefore people with Down’s syndrome do not “suffer”,
nor are they “victims” of their condition. Down’s syndrome is only a part of the person; they
should not be referred to as “a Down’s” or “a Down’s person”. People with Down’s syndrome
are all unique individuals and should be acknowledged as a person first and foremost.
It is important to think of the person first, e.g. John is 29 and has Down’s syndrome. "
Am I responsible for my child being born with Down Syndrome?,No you didn’t. Down Syndrome is caused by having extra genetic material in the cells. This is caused by an error in Subdivision in the egg or sperm cells. The cause of the extra genetic material that causes Down Syndrome is not known.
How do I explain Down syndrome to my children and family members?,"Parents use every opportunity they can to explain to the siblings, especially if they are young.
Sometimes the siblings will want to know why their brother or sister hasn’t achieved a certain milestone e.g. walking like other age mates. Take this opportunity to explain to the children what Down Syndrome is and that the slow milestone achievement is as a result of the condition. Have these simple conversations around the condition as often as you can."
Who is more susceptible to Down Syndrome?,"There is no one on this planet that was immune to Down syndrome at conception. Anyone can be born with Down syndrome regardless of their race, ethnicity, socio-economic status."
Are people with Down syndrome different from the rest of us?,"They are not different. These individuals are slow in achieving certain milestones in their lives. However, they get there eventually. This does not make them any different from us."
Do Individuals with Down Syndrome die young?,"No. Thanks to research and medical improvements, the life span of these individuals has improved up to 60 to 80 years."
Will my child achieve all the milestones normal babies achieve?,"Children with Down Syndrome will achieve all the milestones e.g. walking, talking etc. The only thing that may be different is the fact that they take time to achieve these milestones. They will, however, get there eventually."
Will baby with Down Syndromes be able to breastfeed?,It is possible for infants with Down syndrome and no associated health complications to eventually establish full breastfeeding. Mothers that wish to breastfeed their infant with Down syndrome require anticipatory guidance and continuing lactation and family support.
Do we need to buy anything special for our children with Down Syndromes?,"The majority of our parents advise that they have not needed to buy anything special and if they have equipment from older children/relatives they are able to use the same again. 
A few babies require a car seat that is more horizontal than upright. It has noticed that many rave over the Shnuggle bath, that was designed and created by parents of a child with Down syndrome. "
How do we tell friends and family?,"This is obviously very personal to each family.  In general we see that friends and family will follow your lead, and so if you share the news in a positive way, you should receive positive responses.  
Some new parents just tell friends and family they are in close contact with as and when, others choose to pop a post on social media.  There’s never a one size fits all way, so you do feels what’s comfortable for you and your family. "
How do I know how severe the learning disability will be?,"As with any new born baby, no one can predict how your little one will develop, what their strengths will be and what they may find more challenging.
Having a condition such as Down syndrome that can easily be diagnosed, does mean that your baby will be eligible for extra medical checks and support to help them to develop and flourish.  Some of our children have no additional health needs, aside from common ailments; others have more complex needs.  It is estimated that approximately 15-20% of people with Down syndrome have a dual diagnosis of autism.
Parents often look for signs to indicate how severe the learning disability may be.  We do not know of any indicators, as with the typical population, there are folk with Down syndrome who make tremendous progress in education, others less so.  Parenting a child with Down syndrome, does highlight there are so many more qualities, strengths and abilities than those traditionally measured in education. People with Down syndrome are often extremely empathetic, kind, considerate and unselfish.  There are of course always exceptions!!  "
What are the general Symptoms of Down Syndrome?,"Down syndrome can have many effects, and it’s different for each person. Some will grow up to live almost entirely on their own, while others will need more help taking care of themselves.
Mental abilities vary, but most people with Down syndrome have mild to moderate issues with thinking, reasoning, and understanding. They’ll learn and pick up new skills their whole lives, but they may take longer to reach important goals like walking, talking, and developing social skills.
People with Down syndrome tend to have certain physical features in common. These may include:
• Eyes that slant up at the outer corner
• Small ears
• Flat noses
• Tongue that sticks out
• Tiny white spots in the colored part of the eyes
• Short neck and overall height
• Small hands and feet
• Short stature
• Loose joints
• Weak muscle tone and joints
• Small pinky fingers that curve in
• One crease across the palm of the hand
Many people with Down syndrome don’t have any other health issues, but some do. Some conditions include eye disease, hearing loss and ear infections, sleep apnea, and heart problems.
People with Down syndrome may also have trouble with behavior – they may not pay attention well, or can be obsessive about some things. That’s because it’s harder for them to control their impulses, relate to others, and manage their feelings when they get frustrated."
How can I prevent Down syndrome?,"You can’t prevent Down syndrome since it’s a genetic condition. To learn more about your risk of having a child with a genetic condition, talk to your healthcare provider about genetic testing."
"What resources are available for people living with Down syndrome and their families?
","There are resources available to people with Down syndrome and their families. Many families join Down syndrome support groups to share their experiences and ways to help their children live a healthy, full life.
People with Down syndrome will likely need assistance throughout their lives. In addition to ongoing therapies, this could include help with education, employment and living independently. A variety of organizations offer resources to help educate and empower people living with Down syndrome and their families.
The National Down Syndrome Society and the National Association for Down Syndrome are two of the most common resources people use for more information and support."
