# Chatbot App with Clarifai Vision and GPT-4 Integration

## Overview
This Flask application serves as a simple chatbot utilizing the Clarifai Vision API and GPT-4 model for generating responses. 

It provides a basic web interface where users can input queries, and the application responds based on both a predefined dataset and GPT-4 model predictions.

## Features
- Utilizes Clarifai Vision API for image-related predictions.
- Fallback mechanism using GPT-4 model for questions not found in the dataset.
- Provides a simple web interface for user interaction.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8.10
- Flask3.0.1
- Pandas
- Clarifai Python SDK
